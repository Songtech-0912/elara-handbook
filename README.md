# The Elara Handbook

The Elara Handbook is Project Elara's open knowledge repository and documentation. Everything you'd ever need to learn, develop, or contribute to Project Elara can be found here!

:warning: The handbook is actively developed and will not be complete for quite a while. Patience is appreciated!

## About the Handbook

The Elara Handbook is written in Markdown and Jupyter notebooks (with exception of the API docs, generated by Rust's native documentation generator) using JupyterBook.
