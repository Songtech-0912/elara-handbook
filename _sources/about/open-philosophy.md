# Open Philosophy

> "As we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours, and this we should do freely and generously."

Project Elära follows a strict philosophy of openness:

- The project is a collaborative **open effort**, with contributions from all being accepted
- All code written as part of the project is **open-source** and **dedicated to the public domain**
- All creative resources of the project are licensed under the **CC0 public domain license**
- All hardware produced in the project will be **open hardware** with documentation and design specifications freely available

By dedicating Project Elära to the public domain, no one can take control of the technology for themselves, and everyone will be ensured free and unlimited access to the research. Because science should be open and should benefit everyone.
