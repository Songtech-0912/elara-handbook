# Vision of the community

Project Elära is not the work of one individual, but an entire community, and we want this community to be one we can be proud of. We want to create a community that is:

- Welcoming
- Kind
- Understanding
- Selfless
- Supportive
- Safe

We will explore each of these facets of a good community in detail in this chapter.

## Welcoming

We want a community that reflects the diversity of all humanity, and allows everyone to have a voice and feel valued. Thus, we must stress that this community must be an **entirely** non-judgemental, non-competitive, and non-elitist place, where everyone is free to share their ideas without intimidation. We will treat everyone as a human being and we will do everything we can to give everyone a sense of belonging here. This means we will, in accordance with the Covenant, not accept any harrassment and hate, nor tolerate any individuals or groups whose aim is to harrass, abuse, or harm anyone in any way.

## Kind

We want a community that brings out the best in people. We ask that everyone act courteously, gently, and compassionately to others. Always try to act in good faith, and be considerate before saying or doing anything. Be sensitive to others, especially those with a different point of view. Try to help others and lift others up, instead of being angry, harsh, rash, or mean. Celebrate each other's accomplishments, and be happy for each other in the community. Be forgiving of accidental mistakes that happen. The world can always use a little more kindness.

## Understanding

Everyone is different, and everyone is unique and special in their own way. We celebrate our differences, and we ask everyone to respect the differences. Remember that there may be different ways to do the same thing, and no one way is the "best" way. Don't try to force one way of life upon someone else, and try to see someone else's point of view. Incorporate others and don't exclude others just because they are different in some way.

## Selfless

We ask that we all try to put others first. Yes, we all have our own wants and needs, but the community as a whole will benefit if we also make sure we consider the wants and needs of others. We ask that everyone go the extra mile in making someone else's lives better, and be dedicated to helping others. Our concern for each other and the world around us is the spirit that binds and inspires all of us.

## Supportive

We want everyone to encourage and inspire others. It doesn't have to be much, but everyone can use a helping hand at some point or another. Be here for one another and care for each other. Let one member's support of another inspire another, who inspires another, who inspires countless more.

## Safe

No community can be a true community without its members feeling safe, and thus, we will take every measure to protect the community. It goes without saying that threatening, hostile, or intentionally hurtful acts will not be tolerated in the community. We ask that if any members have disagreements, they settle their differences through the Covenant Council rather than taking direct action themselves. If anyone feels unsafe in the community, they are free to anonymously speak to any of the members of the Varyë, and we will make sure to secure the community.
