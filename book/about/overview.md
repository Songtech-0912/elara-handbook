# Overview

Project Elära is an open effort to realize faster-than-light travel, black hole energy generation, and advance research towards other astrophysics breakthroughs. Ultimately, the project aims to achieve high-speed interstellar travel, create a near-infinite energy source, remove humanity's dependence on fossil fuels, and ensure a life worthy of human dignity for all humanity.

## A tourist's guide to the project

Project Elära advances research into two main areas: spacetime metric engineering and black hole superradiance reactors.

For realizing faster-than-light travel, the project will develop a new machine-learning assisted approach to predicting Alcubierre-like spacetime metrics, based on existing research on the Alcubierre metric.

The **Alcubierre metric** is a theoretical method by which faster-than-light travel may be achieved in the context of General Relativity. The metric describes a “shell” of spacetime formed by the contraction of spacetime in front and the expansion of spacetime behind. Since there is no limit to the speed at which spacetime itself expands, the shell may be accelerated to any speed, even faster than the speed of light.

However, a practical realization of the metric is hindered by its prohibitively high energy requirements, — in its basic form, more than 100,000 times the mass-energy of the universe. Project Elära aims to address this issue with a neural network that can devise variants of Alcubierre-like spacetime metrics with modified characteristics, reducing total energy requirements considerably, and enabling superluminal interstellar travel in a near-modern time span.

For realizing black hole energy generation, the project will develop superradiance reactors that extract energy from artificial rotating black holes.

These reactors utilize the **superradiance effect**, where light trapped around a black hole would be amplified in the black hole's ergosphere. A reflective cavity enclosing the black hole would cause exponential amplification, and an outlet in the cavity would produce a concentrated super-high-energy beam. This beam would be a power source second only to antimatter, releasing enough energy in seconds to power humanity for thousands of years. The faster-than-light spacecraft developed as part of Project Elära utilize these superradiance reactors for producing the energy quantities required for the expansion and contraction of spacetime.

As well as being the primary energy source for the faster-than-light drives, Project Elära also aims to devise a variant of the reactors for terrestrial application. Such a reactor would be kept at one of the Lagrange points, and a large power satellite array would transmit the power as electromagnetic waves to receiver stations around the globe. Rectennas would then convert the electromagnetic energy back to DC electricty for power grids. With the capacity to produce virtually limitless energy, superradiance reactors would be able to ensure a post-scarcity future for all of humanity. And, by diverting a tiny fraction of their power output into carbon sequestration, carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere can quickly fall to pre-industrial levels in the blink of an eye.

Finally, the project will aim to realize a comprehensive set of orbital construction technologies necessary for both superluminal interstellar spacecraft and superradiance reactors. In particular, lifter spacecraft will be developed for rapid transport of materials and personnel to space. These spacecraft will operate using a hybrid propulsion system, using the air as the propellant at lower altitudes and transitioning to onboard stored hydrogen propellant in the upper atmosphere. Lasers would heat the propellant to extremely high temperatures and then expell the propellant for thrust. Meanwhile, fission-catalysed pulse fusion reactors on the ground would generate and beam power aboard through microwaves. As the lifter spacecraft carry no onboard power source, they are capable of lifting extremely large quantities to orbit, essential in building the space infrastructure required for Project Elära to come to fruition.

## What is Elära?

In the Commandúléan language, _elära_ is the word for hope. And Project Elära ultimately serves to create the future all of us hope for - one where the world will forever be at peace and there will be plenty for all.

Project Elära is a choice to have hope, despite knowing of the impossible odds. It represents the best of us, the good we can accomplish when we put our efforts towards the good of all humankind.
