# Using the Handbook

First, this Handbook is meant to be a comprehensive guide and learning tool for every part of the project. It should be conceivably possible for anyone to self-learn everything about the project from minimal basics using this Handbook. A future goal is that this Handbook will be translated into multiple languages, so anyone can read this Handbook in their native language.

In pursuit of this goal, the Handbook is written in a very specific style. It seeks to use simple, unambiguous language, and never assume something is "obvious" to the reader. In addition, when complete, it is meant to include many, many fully worked-out practice problems to reinforce understanding. 

The Handbook, however, also has another purpose: as a safeguard for the project. That is, no matter what disasters may happen to the project itself, copies of the Handbook will allow it to live on. Anyone sharing the ideals of the project should be able to self-learn from the Handbook and rebuilt the project from scratch if need be.
