Countless authors, physicists, mentors, and online resources made this book possible, and this book was the product of collaboration between researchers and students around the world. The contributors to this book include:

- Jacky Song

The incredible book [A Most Incomprehensible Thing](https://amostincomprehensiblething.wordpress.com/) provided great insights into General Relativity and gave the Elara Handbook its approach to detailed, step-by-step teaching. [Khan Academy's](khanacademy.org/) excellent calculus and multivariable calculus courses helped tremendously. Grant Sanderson's YouTube channel [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown) provided a lot of the guidance behind the linear algebra series. [Eigenchris](https://www.youtube.com/@eigenchris), [Andrew Dotson](https://www.youtube.com/@AndrewDotsonvideos) and [Physics with Elliot](https://www.physicswithelliot.com) motivated a lot of the examples and explanatory derivations. Finally, we would like to thank [Dr. Harold White](https://lsiorg.wpengine.com/sonny-white/) of Limitless Space Institute and Andrew Bramante of Greenwich High School for their incredible wisdom and support. A partial list of other resources consulted can be found on the project website at <https://elaraproject.github.io/acknowledgements>.

The importance of openness and sharing knowledge in science cannot be overstated. This book is a testament to this fact.
