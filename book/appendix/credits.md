# Contributions

At Project Elara, we have a policy that all contributions _must_ be given proper credit for, no matter how small, and that any results that were independently found by two (or more) researchers will be given equal and shared credit. We therefore maintain this list of contributions and update it as frequently as possible.

## Pre-2024

```{note}
As these contributions were prior to December 2024 (when this list was started) there may some inaccuracies in reporting contributions. Please report any missing or erroneous contributions to the Project.

## 2024
