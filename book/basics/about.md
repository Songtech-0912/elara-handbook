# Project Elara overview

Project Elära is an open effort to advance research that we hope will make a better future possible. We have a research program covering a wide variety of current and anticipated areas: space power swarms, high-speed interplanetary travel, non-invasive laser-based medical treatment, atmospheric power beaming to remote locations, and more. 

Further, we are keen to participate in research partnerships and collaborations to extend our research programs further, in which we freely exchange our knowledge and expertise. We have hopes of forming strong alliances and bringing together teams from around the world to collaborate in realizing what may seem impossible and building a future worthy of our future generations.

## A tourist's guide to the project

We are (for now) a small research organization based at Rensselaer Polytechnic institute, which has conducted research for the past 3 years. We work to push frontiers in science and engineering and make world-changing technologies possible.

Our primary focus is on **space power swarms**, which collect energy from our Sun from space and beam it back to Earth. When fully-realized, this technology would generate power at an order of magnitude above nearly any means of power generation we could conceive of, even above nuclear fission and fussion. Further, the same technology used in space power swarms could be carried over to a multitude of other applications, including **interplanetary and interstellar spaceflight**, as well as **humanitarian technologies** here on Earth. It could even pave the way for highly-advanced technologies that are likely centuries away, including spacetime metric engineering and black hole reactors (the reasons for why will become apparent later on in this Handbook). Further, the entire project is dedicated to the public domain, with no copyright or patent or any fees, allowing others to build on our work. We are committed into ensuring it will remain free and openly-accessible forever.

We realize that working on research this ambitious is not possible to complete within any short time frame, especially for an organization determined to share its technologies for free. For this reason, this project is meant to be a project built on the work of countless researchers and scientists, likely worldwide and across many generations. We hope that our vision of a hopeful future inspires solidarity and unity that will act as a positive force against cynicism and division around the world.

## What is Elara?

In a constructed language, _elära_ (anglicized: _elara_) is the word for *hope*. And Project Elara ultimately serves to create the future all of us hope for - one where the world will forever be at peace, where all human beings are guaranteed lives of dignity.

Project Elara is a choice to have hope, despite knowing of the (nearly-) impossible odds. We hope that it can represent the best of us, the good we can accomplish when we put our efforts towards the good of all humankind.
