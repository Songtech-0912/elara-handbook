# Project organization

We always believe that our mission at Project Elara is **first and foremost** our concern for humanity and determination in building a hopeful future for our descendants, not one that can be reduced to pure research or technology. However, there is no denying that there is _a lot_ of technology and research as well as logistics involved in carrying out our mission. Project Elara is a complex project, with many, many components. We will go over each of these components.

## The Elara Handbook

The Handbook is perhaps the most recognizable component of Project Elara - after all, you are reading it right now! It serves as Project Elära's central documentation and reference work and should be regarded as the most up-to-date reference for the Project. In addition, it serves as a guided learning resource, and we strongly recommend reading it for new members. We intend it to be as comprehensive as possible - it is well over 100 pages long at the moment of writing, so do not expect you need to read all of it!

## Project Elara's GitHub

The developer hub is an as-yet incomplete section that will be completely dedicated to the programming aspects of the project, including full tutorials on the Python, Rust, C, C++, and JavaScript languages, a detailed guide to machine learning and numerical methods, and developer tutorials. Additionally, it will contain detailed design and architecture documentation for the [Project Elära libraries](https://github.com/elaraproject/), as well as links to the generated API documentation for all of the project's software.

## The Project Elara organization

administration
The Elära ecosystem is the final component of the project's documentation, and contains information about the community, governance structures, contribution agreements, and so on, as well as collaborations and alliances with other organizations. Again, it is not complete at time of writing, but will be slowly added to with time.
