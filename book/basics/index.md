# Introduction

In this chapter, we will introduce Project Elara from its very basics. You'll learn the details of what it's about, why we do it, and _how_ we do what we do. In addition, we will go over the general math and physics to understand the Project's research. By reading through this chapter, you will have taken the first step along the Project Elara journey. We hope it will be a very fulfilling one.
