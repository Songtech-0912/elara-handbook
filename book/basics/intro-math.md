# Introductory mathematics

Up to this point, we've gone through the details of the Project and explained its work in broad terms. But to gain a _deep understanding_ of how everything works, we do have to use a reasonable amount of mathematics (in particular, calculus) and physics, which, as you'll soon see, are very closely-related fields. We will start everything at basic algebra, and build up to calculus-based physics. These can be difficult topics; take it at your own pace. We hope it will be an enjoyable read.
