# Introductory physics

Previously, we have reviewed the mathematical concepts that are crucial to our next area of study: physics. Physics is **not** simply applied math, because it also relies on observation, scientific reasoning, and systematic analysis. Nearly every part of the project requires, to some extent, applying physics and physical principles.

To have a good grasp of physics is essential, but it can certainly be a very intimidating subject. We will go through it step-by-step, and we will limit ourselves (in this section) to physics at a basic level. It may be helpful to re-read sections that are confusing or hard to understand. We hope that this section will prepare you well for more advanced topics ahead.
