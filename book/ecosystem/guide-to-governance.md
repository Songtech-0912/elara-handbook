# Guide to governance

Project Elära is intended to foster a free and open community, governed by democratic ideals. As part of this, Project Elära has a Covenant, which can be read in full on the next chapter. The Covenant is like a mini-constitution, and details the foundational principles and organization of the community's government. Here is a condensed explanation of the Covenant.

First, the Covenant protects the human rights of the entire community. The entire first section is devoted to outlining these rights, and how they will be realized. Ideally, the community would be completely decentralized, but to assist in coordinating such a complex project, some centralization is inevitably necessary. So the Covenant also describes the Varyë Elära, or Varyë for short, the community government of Project Elära.

The Varyë has three branches, the legislature, executive, and judiciary. All three branches are completely independent of each other, as they have separate and distinct powers. The legislature is the only branch that can pass laws, the executive the only branch that can implement laws, and the judiciary the only branch that can judge laws.

The legislature and executive are both democratically elected. The voting process guarantees universal suffrage in the community, and voters are allowed to choose multiple, none, or one candidate. Candidates must attain an absolute majority (greater than 50%) to be elected; otherwise, the election is repeated until a candidate gains an absolute majority. The legislature allows all candidates who attain an absolute majority to take office, while the executive admits only one candidate, specifically the candidate that gains the most votes in the second round of elections.

The legislature is the Elära Senate, and can make, veto, and amend any law. The executive is headed by the Steward of Project Elära, who implements the laws passed by the Senate. Additionally, the executive heads all of the executive departments, and regulates and facilitates their operation. The Steward generally cannot act in any way independent of Senate approval, ensuring the accountability of the Steward directly to the Senate, and indirectly to the members of the community.

Finally, the judiciary is the Judicial Council, and is responsible for arbitration in the community as well as ensuring that all laws abide by the Covenant. It is chosen by sortition of all background-checked members of the community who apply for the position. It reserves the right to remove any member of the Varyë who violates the Covenant, which is why the random process of sortition is necessary. Judicial Councilors have one term and cannot apply for a second term.

The entire system of government is constructed such as to make abuses of power as unlikely as possible, and to preserve the freedoms of the community, to ensure that the project remains free, independent, and democratic long into the future.
