# Theoretical physics

As well as its main work, Project Elara also conducts far-future research into speculative theoretical concepts, including the following:

- Laser perturbation of the quantum vacuum for the production of exotic matter
- Artificial black holes and harnessing black hole energy through (a) black hole space swarms and (b) superradiance reactors
- Spacetime metric engineering including warp drives (and variations thereof), wormholes, and other forms of gravitational engineering
- Numerical relativity and adjacent applications of neural networks

Research into these topics require a strong knowledge of general relativity and relativistic quantum mechanics (including quantum field theory). The following sections give an overview of the necessary theoretical background in these topics.
