    "Typically, the spirit of the Elara handbook is to present all the ideas of a topic at once, without a lot of prior background knowledge. However, for quantum mechanics, it is _especially_ good to get a grasp of complex numbers, because the use of complex numbers often makes the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics foreign and indecipherable. So dive in, enjoy, and let's see how an mathematical idea that was once said to exist \"only in our minds\" would turn out to be one of the most invaluable tools to solve real-world problems..."
