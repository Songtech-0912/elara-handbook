    "The final method of solving differential equations that cannot be easily solved using any other means is by using **numerical methods**. Numerical methods take the initial conditions of a differential equation and calculate a tiny change $dy$ in a function caused by a small step along the function's input $dx$. Then, they add that little change $dy$ to the existing value of $y$. By doing this process many, many times, over and over, an entire solution to a differential equation can be approximated. "
