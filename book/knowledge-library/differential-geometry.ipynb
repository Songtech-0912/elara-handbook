    "The whole idea behind tensors is that we want to create mathematical objects that are the same in every coordinate system - we call that **invariant**. Why is this? The reason is because in the universe, objects _are_ invariant. Intuitively, if you ask a friend to push you, whether you measure the force of your friend's push in cylindrical or spherical or cartesian coordinates, you're going to feel the same force. If you have, say, a magnetic force, that force is going to still exist and be the same physical quantity whichever coordinate system we use. The same goes for any other physical quantity, such as momentum, velocity, energy, etc. It makes sense that just using a different coordinate system to measure, say, a racecar, wouldn't cause that racecar to be 20% faster or 15% slower - instead, the speed of the racecar would be the same. Mathematical objects that have the same _physical_ quantity between differing coordinate systems are called **tensors**. Some tensors are scalars such as temperature; others are vectors such as position; still others are matrices; the commonality is that they correspond to one measurable physical object."
