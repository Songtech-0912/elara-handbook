For example, you could say that the spacetime _outside_ of a black hole is a vacuum (because there is no matter), but the spacetime would still be curved (because the black hole warps its surrounding spacetime, even if we only include the spacetime around a black hole and not the black hole itself)."

    "The action must be composed of scalar-valued functions (or scalars), as it is an integral over all spacetime, and multidimensional integrals can only take scalar-valued functions or scalars to integrate over (see for yourself that this must be true). But it must also include information about the curvature of spacetime and spacetime itself. As we know, all the information about the curvature of spacetime is captured in the Riemann tensor. But the Riemann tensor is not a scalar-valued function - it is instead a (rank-4) tensor-valued function. So we have to find a way to get a scalar from the Riemann tensor. We already know of a scalar that can be formed from the Riemann tensor - the Ricci scalar. We want to add an additional proportionality constant in front, which is also a scalar, because we'd expect to see constants in our final field equations as well. We can always set the constant $\\kappa = 1$ if we find it's not necessary later. Since both the curvature of spacetime and the matter and energy present within spacetime should act on the metric, we add them together. Finally, since spacetime is often curved, we need a factor of $\\sqrt{-g}$ to make sure the volume element $d^4 x$ is the same size no matter what coordinates or what spacetime we use. So from there, we obtain the action."
