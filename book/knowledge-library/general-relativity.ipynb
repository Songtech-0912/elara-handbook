Shouldn't this be illegal in tensor algebra, where we're not supposed to swap free indices in the same equation? There is a nuance here - we can swap free indices **only** if we subtitute each and every index with a corresponding different index. That, is, if you have an equation $x^i = g^{ij} b_j$, you can't simply say \"I want to swap $j \\to i$ and make the equation $x^i = g^{ii} b_i$\". Here, you're selectively substituting $j \\to i$ without making a substitution for $i$, so the equation is wrong! But you can say that \"I'll rewrite the equation using different indices, substituting $i \\to a$ and $j \\to b$, so I have $x^a = g^{ab} b_b$\".

But it must also include information about the curvature of spacetime and spacetime itself. As we know, all the information about the curvature of spacetime is captured in the Riemann tensor. But the Riemann tensor is not a scalar-valued function - it is instead a (rank-4) tensor-valued function. So we have to find a way to get a scalar from the Riemann tensor. We already know of a scalar that can be formed from the Riemann tensor - the Ricci scalar. We want to add an additional proportionality constant in front, which is also a scalar, because we'd expect to see constants in our final field equations as well. We can always set the constant $\\kappa = 1$ if we find it's not necessary later. Since both the curvature of spacetime and the matter and energy present within spacetime should act on the metric, we add them together. Finally, since spacetime is often curved, we need a factor of $\\sqrt{-g}$ to make sure the volume element $d^4 x$ is the same size no matter what coordinates or what spacetime we use.
