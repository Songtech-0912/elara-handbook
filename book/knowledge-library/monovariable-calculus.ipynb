    "\n",
    "Over its nearly 400-year history, calculus has evolved into perhaps the most versatile and broad field of mathematics. There is multivariable calculus, vector calculus, stochastic calculus, the calculus of variations, tensor calculus, lambda calculus...we could go on and on...\n",

In monovariable calculus, we're concerned with developing the fundamental ideas of calculus. These ideas will carry over to all the more advanced forms of calculus. Through them, you're realize how calculus has such versatility and power."

Unfortunately, each of them published their work at the same time with differing notations. Leibniz wrote the derivative with the notation $\\frac{df}{dx}$; Newton used the notation $\\dot f$. Lagrange and Euler, not long after, came up with the notation $f'(x)$. In any case, Leibniz and Newton...got into a fight, which became a political controversy, and other mathematicians decided to develop *other* notations as well. So, sadly, there is not a unified notation around calculus."
