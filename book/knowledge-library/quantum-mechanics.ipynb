    "Up to this point, we've explored physics that obeyed the principles of predictability and certainty. We took it for granted that particles moved on definite paths, that if we knew everything about the system we could predict everything about how it would evolve. All of those assumptions completely break down in quantum mechanics, when we take a look at the world near the scale of atoms. We'll explore this fascinating new world - and in time, hopefully realize that \"the quantum world is not spooky or incomprehensible - it's just way different\"."

    "But in the quantum world, every property of a microscopic particle has to be made of indivisible unit values. One way to think about it is to imagine you have several basketballs - it would make sense to have 0 basketballs, or 50 basketballs, or 12 basketballs, but it wouldn't make sense to have $\\pi$ basketballs or 1.513 basketballs. The indivisible unit, in our case, is one basketball, and in quantum mechanics we call the unit a **quantum** (plural _quanta_). For example, the quantum of charge is the elementary charge constant $e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}$ Coulombs. This means that you can only have a charge of $2e$ or $5e$ or $17e$, never $1.352e$. The quantum of energy (for visible light) is approximately $2.605 \\times 10^{-19}$ joules. We call properties that are composed of quanta **quantized**."

    "However, we hit one more roadblock. If light is a particle, why can't we just measure its observable properties (such as position) and know how it behaves? Through experimentation, scientists tried, and failed, to do exactly this. They concluded that quantum particles cannot be found exactly. We can only measure probabilities by using a **wavefunction** that describes the state of a quantum system. The wavefunction is oftentimes a complex function, and has no direct physical meaning (which makes sense; all physical quantities are real numbers, not complex numbers!) However, it turns out that if you integrate the square of the wavefunction, you find the **probability** of a particle being in a position at a particular time."
