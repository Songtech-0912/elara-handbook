    "Up to this point, we've explored physics that obeyed the principles of predictability and certainty. We took it for granted that particles moved on definite paths, that if we knew everything about the system we could predict everything about how it would evolve. All of those assumptions completely break down in quantum mechanics, when we take a look at the world near the scale of atoms. We'll explore this fascinating new world - and in time, hopefully realize that \"the quantum world is not spooky or incomprehensible - it's just way different\"."

    "When we speak of observable properties of a macroscopic object, such as its speed, momentum, and energy, we expect that these properties can take on _any_ value. For instance, we can have a speed of 5.34 m/s, or 100,000 m/s, or 0.0015 m/s. These are called **continuous** properties."

    "But in the quantum world, every property of a microscopic particle has to be a certain integer multiple of a indivisible unit value. One way to think about it is to imagine you have several basketballs - it would make sense to have 0 basketballs, or 50 basketballs, or 12 basketballs, but it wouldn't make sense to have $\\pi$ basketballs or 1.513 basketballs. The indivisible unit value, in our case, is one basketball, and in quantum mechanics we call the unit value a **quantum** (plural _quanta_). For example, the quantum of charge is the elementary charge constant $e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}$ Coulombs. This means that you can only have a charge of $2e$ or $5e$ or $17e$, never $1.352e$. The quantum of energy (for visible light) is approximately $2.605 \\times 10^{-19}$ joules. We call properties that are composed of quanta **quantized**."

    "However, we hit one more roadblock. If light is a particle, why can't we just measure its observable properties (such as position) and know how it behaves? Through experimentation, scientists tried, and failed, to do exactly this. They concluded that quantum particles cannot be found exactly. We can only measure probabilities by using a **wavefunction** of a particle. The integral of the squared norm of the wavefunction is the actual probability of the particle actually being in that position at that particular time."
