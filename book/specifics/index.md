# Preface to Chapter 2

After tackling calculus, vectors, matrices, and Newtonian mechanics in chapter 1, we're ready to move on to more advanced topics. In this chapter, we will cover (among other things) more advanced electrodynamics and quantum mechanics, as well as delving deep into the theory behind Project Elara's research and understanding how to perform calculations, run simulations, and perform experimental testing. By the end of this chapter, you will have gained a solid understanding of Project Elara and will be ready to perform research that might one day change the world - we hope that the reading will be very much worth it.
