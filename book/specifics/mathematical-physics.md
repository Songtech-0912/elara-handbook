# Mathematical methods of modern physics

Having covered the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of classical mechanics, we are now ready to move to relativistic and quantum physics. These are the two theories that form the core of **modern physics**, and they require different mathematical tools compared to classical mechanics. Among just a few topics we will explore are tensors, tensor calculus, complex numbers, operators, and eigenvalue problems - all of which play a key role in building our modern understanding in physics.
